# Data Science Challenges

Become a better Data Scientist by working on Data Science Challenges.
Because that's what heroes do!

Every other week, we come up with a challenge which tests and expands our Data Science skills. Initially we set ourselves a time bound (1-2 hours) to work on the challenge and see what insights/questions we can uncover. Following that up, we give ourselves 1-2 weeks to continue to explore the challenge and write up a blog post about our findings. 

Each project will encompass one or several of the following:

- Data Cleaning
- Working with APIs
- Data Storytelling
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning

## Rules

1. Give yourself 1-2 hours to work on the initial challenge.
2. Give yourself 1-2 weeks to continue to explore the challenge and write up a blog post about your findings.
